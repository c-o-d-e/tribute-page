                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1965</strong> - Two computers at MIT Lincoln Lab
                        communicate with one another using packet-switching
                        technology.

                    <li>
                        <strong>1968</strong> - Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN)
                        unveils the final version of the Interface Message
                        Processor (IMP) specifications. BBN wins ARPANET
                        contract.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1969</strong> - On Oct. 29, UCLA's Network
                        Measurement Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI),
                        University of California-Santa Barbara and University of
                        Utah install nodes. The first message is "LO," which was
                        an attempt by student Charles Kline to "LOGIN" to the
                        SRI computer from the university. However, the message
                        was unable to be completed because the SRI system
                        crashed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1972</strong> - BBN's Ray Tomlinson introduces
                        network email. The Internet Working Group (INWG) forms
                        to address need for establishing standard protocols.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1973</strong> - Global networking becomes a
                        reality as the University College of London (England)
                        and Royal Radar Establishment (Norway) connect to
                        ARPANET. The term internet is born.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1974</strong> - The first Internet Service
                        Provider (ISP) is born with the introduction of a
                        commercial version of ARPANET, known as Telenet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1976</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II hits the
                        “send button” on her first email.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1982</strong> - Transmission Control Protocol
                        (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite,
                        commonly known as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for
                        ARPANET. This results in the fledgling definition of the
                        internet as connected TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains
                        the standard protocol for the internet.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        .net, and .int system for naming websites. This is
                        easier to remember than the previous designation for
                        websites, such as 123.456.789.10.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>1990</strong> - Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at
                        CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research,
                        develops HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This
                        technology continues to have a large impact on how we
                        navigate and view the internet today.

                        computers connected to NSFNET grows from 2,000 in 1985
                        to more than 2 million in 1993. The National Science
                        Foundation leads an effort to outline a new internet
                        architecture that would support the burgeoning
                        commercial use of the network.

                        version 4. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses allowing for 4.3
                        billion unique addresses; IPv6, with 128-bit addresses,
                        will allow 3.4 x 1038 unique addresses, or 340 trillion
                        trillion trillion.
